# Christian-Song-Selector
A python program that can help you select a song and give its lyrics as well. The program will also copy those lyrics to your clipboard so that you can paste it anywhere.

I made this program because it allows me to select a song faster and save time compared to me spending lots of time figuring out which song to sing in the church. I hope it becomes useful for you as well. If you like it please consider giving a ðŸŒŸ and share it to others.

# Modules used in this program
1. This python script is connected to a ```SQL``` database written in SQLite that contains all the song names, their lyrics and their language.
2. Python and SQLite is connected through the ```sqlite3``` module which is a built-in module in python for Windows. As for MacOS and Linux you'll have to install it in your environment. The script runs from the database file.
4. The python script uses ```random``` module which is a built-in module in python for all platforms that chooses a song randomly from the database.
5. To copy the lyrics to the clipboard it uses ```pyperclip``` module.

# To run it
1. Make sure python is installed in your device. Any of the newer versions will work.
2. Make sure to download the database file.
3. Make sure that the modules mentioned above are installed. You can use ```pip install [module]``` command to install them. Just replace "[module]" with your desired module and put this command in the command prompt.
4. The database file and the python script doesn't have to be in the same folder. Just make sure to give the file path of the database file in line 8 of the python script.
   ```python
   connection=sqlite3.connect("Database_File_path.db")
   ```

# Optional Adjustments
Currently the database has only 20 songs but you can use any another database with more songs and connect that to the script. Just make sure that the databse file is of sqlite. Also update the SQL commands in the script according to the columns of your table which is in the database file you wish to use. The updation must be done in the script for all the custom functions as all of them use SQL commands corresponding to the database I created.

Otherwise you can add more songs in the database manually by using the necessary SQL commands.
